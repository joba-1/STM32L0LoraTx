# First Prototype Board

## Good News

* It works and sends data
* It wasn't too hard to do the SMD soldering in my new oven (see my Reflowino project)

## Bad News

* The footprint of the RFM95 lib I used is wrong: the side with the antenna is the wrong direction
* The button cell clip works different from what I expected and was smaller
* The pcb antenna may be good for inhouse range but is not good enough for gateways some 5-10 km away 

So I had to cut some pcb traces and solder some wires. But in the end it worked and has a nice form factor!
